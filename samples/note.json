I see your post. Good job. I also added my 2 cents worth about people not posting much lately (sidebar). Some folks are practically tied to their computer (or cell phone) and others just drop in once a day or every few days. I agree that it's sad if someone asks a question and no one says \"BOO\" to them. We could all do a little more there. But we can't all be available 24/7 and have all the answers. I wish I knew everything but I sure don't. Don't know what my point is. I've been crabby lately so please ignore me. Nice to see you.
