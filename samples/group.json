If you have an article, share it.  If you have a treatment that works for you, share that too.\r\n \r\nWe will get better because we do have control on our overall health and can eliminate/reduce inflammation in our body.

Sulfites are a preservative found in/on almost everything.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kennuncorked.com/lifestyle_health_sulfite_sensitivity.pdf  \r\n\r\nSulfites are EVERYWHERE!  Beer, wine, pizza, coffee, etc.  Even my Subway sandwich!!  Also check your lotions, shampoos and laundry detergent!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most doctors don't seem to know a lot about this or even consider the causes.  I've been seeing my allergist and he mentioned that it was a possibility, but never really pursued this fact.\r\n\r\nTo test to see if you may be allergic to sulfites, stay away from anything containing sulfites for a few days until you are symptom free.  Eat no more than five dried apricots, they naturally contain sulfites.  If you have a reaction, you have your answer.  I ate one apricot and had a major reaction about 30 minutes later.\r\n\r\nI've been trolling the internet for a \"cure\".  So far, all I've found is lots of B12 and this article that recommends Vitamin C, Quercitin and Bromellain.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.helium.com/items/354530-allergy-to-sulfite-symptoms-and-treatment  \r\n\r\nBenadryl my help too.\r\n\r\nI really hope this helps someone, I've been struggling for so long!", "/groups/insomniacs_unite": "This is a group for anyone who struggles with insomnia, whether it be a once in a great while thing, or a near daily occurrence; whether it be because of chronic pain or illness, or if it's an inability to \"turn off your brain\" at night.

As a direct result of its use, I suffered a brain bleed eventually leading to a stroke in the right frontal cortex of my brain.\r\n\r\n   I am now permanently disabled. When the stroke was discovered around March of 2008, I was extensively examined and tested in an effort for the doctors to discover the cause of the stroke. I wasn't over weight, nor had any other physiological disorders that they could find as a cause.  Even though all of these physicians and neurologists were aware that I was on the Lexapro, at that time, nobody ever made the connection between its prolonged use, and brain bleeds and strokes.  This is probably because this information was not common knowledge to neurologists and physicians who dispensed the Lexapro to their patients at that time.\r\n\r\n   It was not until about mid 2010 that information began to appear to those in the medical circle and the public's eyes about the risks of taking SSRI's such as Lexapro.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.drugwatch.com/2012/10/19/study-antidepressants-increase-risk-of-bleeding-in-the-brain-and-stroke/\r\n\r\n Unfortunately I have been unable to take any recourse towards obtaining some compensation for my damages incurred as all of this information was released to the public after the 3 year MA. Statute of limitations had already expired. And I am presently unable to find any legal advocacy in my effort to make my strongly evidenced case against Forrest Labs Pharmaceuticals. \r\n\r\n  Today, I am permanently disabled and have lost everything that I ever worked for and every friend that I ever had because of the dramatic changes to my personality.   Due to the fact that none of my Dr.'s were aware that Lexapro placed their patients at a 50% higher risk of suffering a bleed or stroke in the brain, and since I was unaware that I had suffered a bleed leading to a stroke at the time, they kept me on the Lexapro for an additional 5 months even though I had already been taking the 10mg tabs for the previous 2 years.  I had repeatedly returned to my Dr. complaining to her that there was something wrong, but she took no action.\r\n \r\n    Ironically, after the stroke was discovered about 6 months after my first complaints to my Dr.'s. It was now finally understood that I had incurred brain damage due to an acorn sized piece of my right frontal lobe being destroyed in addition to some serious personality changes, \r\n\r\n  At The time, Neurologists felt that my best treatment was to continue taking antidepressants to help me to cope with my overwhelming any of my personal  and psychological issues at hand.\r\n\r\n    Although I was ignorant of the cause of my stroke at that time, so were all those highly trained and educated doctors,  I refused to take a sedated path through life and to date, although my life in shards and for the most part ruined, I have managed fine without these drugs, although I'm not overly a happy fellow.\r\n\r\n   Never once did anyone ever warn me or inform me about the high risks of taking Lexapro. My Primary care Dr. didn't, nor my neurologist, or my pharmacist and in fact, none of these individuals even had a clue at that time as to how I could have ever suffered a right frontal stroke in the first place. Their only solution is that I should continue being medicated. If I would have followed their advise,  I would probably be brain dead, a vegetable, paralyzed or worse.\r\n\r\n  Today, I have been rendered an impotent statistical casualty of Forrest Labs Pharmaceuticals, who seem to remain absolved from any recourse I might have been able to pursue against them because The Ma. Statute of Limitations is 3 years on bad drugs, yet this information was barely, if even, available until the last year or so.   I feel that I deserve to be fairly compensated, as to help me better establish some sort of quality of life for the remainder of my lifetime. At best, I can only pray that some attorney out there will read about my case and afford me a viable solution or take this case. \r\n\r\n  Thank you for reading this lengthy letter; I was compelled to write it because I saw on this very site, a complete denial that no cases of bleeds and stroke have ever been documented from individuals who took Lexapro. It is a lie and Lexapro for me turned out to be a life killer and not a life giver.\r\n                                          Thank you and well    Ron..  aka...Collateral Damage\r\n", "/groups/law_suit_induced_stress_and_anxiety": "Stressed out about the slow, complicated and expensive legal process with undeterminable outcomes.", "/groups/job_seek": "A group where job seekers can  network and discuss ideas and strategies for finding a job in this tough economy.", "/groups/life101": "This is about the ups and downs, ins & outs of this precarious thing we call \"life\".", "/groups/laserpowerful": "2000mw blue laser pointer\r\nhttp://www.laserpowerful.com/high-powerful-2000mw-blue-laser-pointer.html", "/groups/kidney_disease_and_high_creatinine_level": "A high serum (blood) creatinine level means kidney damage.know kidney disease and creatinine causes ,symptoms ,treatment and diet .", "/groups/life_101": "This is about the ups and downs, ins & outs of this precarious thing we call \"life\".", "/groups/jogging_for_newbies": "A place to give and get tips on jogging and overall healthy living for begginers!", "/groups/kickin_suboxone": "This is a group for those of us who are on the journey to a suboxone-free life.

The conventional medical approach cannot really help the individual cure and prevent the condition, as the root causes of this condition as well as the manifold complications associated with this condition are not addressed by the common conventional treatments of ovarian cysts. Hence, today there is a growing trend to revert back to the natural approach to handling ovarian cyst disorders in all their aspects.\r\nThe importance of the natural approach:\r\nFirst, the natural approach to curing ovarian cysts involves the use of natural safe and gentle remedies. The use of natural remedies often results is much fewer side effects compared to those inflicted by conventional drugs. Secondly, the natural approach targets the root causes of a condition rather than focusing on the symptoms. Thirdly, by tackling the root causes the natural approach aims at long term healing and prevention of your condition. \r\n1.\tSide effects of conventional medication: Conventional medical treatment can give rise to many side effects. Women who have to lose their ovaries can obviously never have children again. These women also often experience change in their personality due to hormonal imbalance. Also, oral contraceptives, which are used prominently to treat the condition, can affect the fertility capabilities of a woman in the long term. Pregnant women cannot use conventional medication, without having to endure significant risks of miscarriage and premature delivery. Compared to this, natural remedies have no side effects. Some forms of natural treatment also put emphasis on strengthening the mental and emotional state of the patient thereby promoting healing in the true sense of the term. \r\n2.\tInefficiency of conventional medication: Conventional medicine provides only temporary relief from the symptoms of ovarian cysts. The ovarian cysts often reoccur after the treatment is discarded. Even after surgery, the patient is not immune to ovarian cysts. In fact research has shown that the growth of ovarian cysts after surgery is very common. Compared to conventional medication, the natural approach provides long-term relief from the condition since it tackles the root cause of ovarian cysts and is therefore more effective. \r\n3.\tImpersonal approach: Conventional medication works according to rule of thumb without paying much attention to individual differences. Hence, conventional medication fails to treat certain conditions, as it lays emphasis on the disease and not the patient. On the other hand, the natural treatment is a often a personalized treatment. Each and every course of treatment varies from one person to another. This is the reason why it has such an astounding success rate. \r\n4.\tExpensive conventional treatment: Conventional treatment for ovarian cysts is very expensive. Besides the huge costs of ovarian surgery, you will have to pay for hospitalization, tests, prescription drugs and more. Natural remedies are comparatively cost effective and therefore women on a shoestring budget can also take advantage of them. \r\nThe natural approach to treating ovarian cysts is effective against most forms of cysts. It can be used to prevent complications and to keep the existing ovarian cyst condition under control. However, these remedies cannot completely cure ovarian cysts. To cure ovarian cysts, a comprehensive holistic and multidimensional form of treatment is required. \r\nThe Holistic approach:\r\nThe only way to effectively treat and prevent ovarian cysts is by using a multidimensional holistic approach to healing. \r\n\r\nUnlike the conventional approach which deals with the inflicted organ or with the symptoms of the disease (and the treatment in often aggressive with a myriad of side effects), the holistic approach treats every disease as part of a whole by firstly restoring natural balance to the body while naturally tackling each causative factor which lead to the condition. In this way, the holistic approach to treating ovarian cysts offers a long term, safe and gentle solution without the side effects of drugs or the risk of surgery while ensuring the prevention of future ovarian cyst recurrence. \r\n", "/groups/naznet": "Weight Loss / Fitness group for users of NazNet.com participating in 2014 fitness challenge.", "/groups/muslim": "This is a Muslim oreiented group I'm sure there's Muslim members here.", "/groups/my_husband_is_addicted_to_oxycodone": "My husband has been taking oxycodone for about a year now.

It is still just getting known in the medical community so you may have to bring it up to your doctor if you think this sounds like something you have been going through. \r\n\r\nMITOCHONDRIAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nMitochondria are small energy-producing structures found in every cell in the body. They serve as the cells' power plants (responsible for the body's energy production, converting food into energy). It's kind of like having a brown out in your body. \r\nMitochondrial diseases result from failures of the mitochondria, specialized compartments present in almost every cell of the body. They are responsible for creating more than 90 percent of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth. The mitochondria are composed of tiny packages of enzymes that speed chemical reaction. These enzymes play an essential role in turning nutrients into energy: they are linked in the electron transport chain (ETC), also known as the respiratory chain, which creates ATP (cellular energy) through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain is the final step in the energy making process in the mitochondrion where most of the ATP is generated. The mitochondrial enzymes (also known as complexes I, II, III and IV) are needed to generate the electron and proton gradient that is utilized by complex V to generate ATP. Defects in any of the enzymes could cause a mitochondrial disease. When mitochondria fail, less and less energy is generated within the cell. When this happens, cell injury and even cell death follow. If this process is repeated on a large scale throughout the body, whole systems begin to fail, and the life of the person in whom this is happening is compromised, changed or even ended. \r\nCurrently there are no known cures. The treatments that are available are limited. Most treatments and medications address only symptoms of the mitochondrial disorder, not the disorder itself. \r\nMitochondrial diseases are extremely complex; due to this complexity the severity of these diseases is unpredictable, and the range of symptoms is diverse. Symptoms may present unexpectedly at any age or they may be evident from birth or infancy. The presentation of symptoms depends upon which organs or systems are most affected by the malfunctioning mitochondria. \r\nDiseases of the mitochondria cause the most damage to cells of organs and systems that require a great deal of energy: the brain, the heart, the skeletal muscles, the kidney, liver and the endocrine and respiratory systems. \r\nThe symptoms that I deal with most frequently are Fatigue, Exercise intolerance, Loss of motor control and balance, Muscle weakness, cramps, stiffness and/or spasms, Gastro intestinal disorders, Respiratory complications, Unstable body temperature, Migraine headaches, Visual/Hearing problems, chronically lowered immune system and susceptibility to infection. Add in high mental stress or extremely cold or hot weather and I suffer with seizures or stroke like episodes. \r\nI only have so much energy available on a daily basis. Some days I feel okay for part of the day. Some days I get tired just getting ready for the day. \r\nI still have to watch how much I do when I do have energy because it does not last long and overdoing will cause me to \u201cCrash\u201d for days or weeks. When I am in a \u201cCrash\u201d, I can barely walk from room to room.  The only thing to do to start getting over this is to rest. My doctor said when my eyes no longer focus, that\u2019s the sign it is time to quit what I am doing and go rest. It's hard to plan ahead since I do not know how I am going to feel from day to day. \r\n\r\nI was diagnosed in 1999. It has been a long journey so far, and who knows what life lays ahead. But I deal with it day to day. \r\n\r\nJoyful\r\n", "/groups/multiples_mommas": "A group for mom's who have the joy of raising twins, triplets, quads, quints, sextuplets and more. \r\n\r\nCome share your stories, vent about daily life raising your multiples (and their siblings if there are any), share ideas and enjoy some mommy time!", "/groups/music_a_natural_healer": "I know music helps me a lot and Im hoping it will do the same thing for you..

It was hard but I completed a two year degree in medicine raising two kids by myself.  I ended up having to stop Ibuprofen in 92 due to a duodenal ulcer.  In 1999 I was diagnosed with hepatitis C and underwent treatment for nine months ending on the very last day of the year 2000.  My symptoms for the fibromyalgia went into remission within a month of starting the treatment, so I considered that the symptoms may have been the hepatitis all along.  Entering into the year 2001 and receiving the good news, that my numbers were less than 100! I was a responder.  I felt better on the treatment than I had in years.  So, I thought it was time for my five year partnership with a great guy end in tying the knot.  We had a small ceremony in our home on January 27, 2001.\r\n\r\nWithin approximately a month, I started noticing symptoms.  They were the same fibro symptoms I had dealt with for 13 years!  However, by two months AFTER TREATMENT, all of the symptoms from the fibromyalgia were back; but this time the pain was worse by tenfold.  I was in tears daily due to the pain.  The inability to concentrate (which was a symptom I acquired more intensely during treatment) is disabling me, now, from doing the documentation that is a MUST as the owner of an Adult Family Home!  The fatigue, the sleep problems and all the rest of the crazy symptoms from fibromyalgia were back but with a vengeance.  \r\n\r\nOr..., maybe, the fibro is back with the added benefit of post hepatitis C treatment symptoms.  Or, perhaps it is all due to the nine months of injecting chemicals into my belly and popping handfuls of drugs!\r\n\r\nWhat ever the case, I feel like I'm in both boats...  I responded to the treatment and feeling great, I celebrated my WIN by getting married.  Then I'm slammed with more misery then I have ever before experienced.  How do I tell my new husband that I'm not sure I can keep running this business that he just bought a house for because we were going to lose it to the landlord selling!   This is just crazy!  I'm better but I feel worse than ever!  What is worse, I am not able to take Ibuprofen or, now, Tylenol because of my all ready compromised liver.\r\n\r\nThat was 2001.  I started on chronic opioid therapy in the summer of that year or I was going to have to shut down a loving care home and turn my back on several people  who loved living here and whom I loved.  Thank God I researched chronic opioid therapy thoroughly before even talking with my doctor about it; and, I have remained completely compliant with dispensing my medications!\r\n\r\nBy the grace of God and a few good employee's, I was able to hang in there for a few more years.  I closed my business on the last day of 2005 but continued caring for one gentleman who had been there for ten years until he died in 2010 and my mom spent her last year with me in mid 2007\r\nto mid 2008.  Believe me though, it has been an extremely hard life and I have neglected many of my own needs and now Social Security doesn't think I have earned my right to disability.  Forty years of working.  Often carrying a full time job and a part time job just to make ends meet while raising my kids and almost NEVER calling in sick unless I thought it would be harmful to other's or I simply could not get my head out of the toilet.\r\n\r\nHere it is, 2014, I can hardly function.  I can't stay focused on the task at hand.  I have all the above symptoms, severe osteoarthritis, severe colitis, and some neurological symptoms that make me drop things constantly.  I am very shaky I can't stand for more than 5-10 minutes, sit up for more than ten minute to a half an hour without becoming too uncomfortable and I never sleep more than two hours at a time without needing to sit up quickly due to pain.   So I don't ever feel rested.  Camping, fishing, gardening, dancing not even an option even though I am no longer tied down to caring for anyone.  Hell, I can\u2019t even get my dishes caught up!  \r\nSo, responder or not, fibromyalgia or not, I think there is something there concerning the issue of post treatment symptoms.  I also think that fibromyalgia is a stealth virus that was introduced in the form of a polio vaccine that was tainted with the cytomegalovirus found in the monkeys that they grow the vaccine in.  A virus that affects the brain which accounts for the variety of symptoms depending on which part of the brain that is most affected.  A virus that is sensitive to the antiviral drugs that are involved with the treatment of Hepatitis C.  \r\nThat is my story, and I am sticking to it!\r\nStrong supporter of Dr. W. John Martin!\r\n(He isolated this \u201cStealth Virus\u201d in his research of vaccinations that he was paid to research.  The Government had him research vaccinations but stripped him of his license when he found something that pointed the finger straight at the Government!!)\r\n\r\n", "/groups/positive_thinking": "This group is to help people needing support towards betterment of life , a channel to motivate members.Thinking, emotions, and behaviors intertwine very closely and each can change the others.

He is a classic narcissist and no matter how hard I worked \r\nor how many jobs I had it was never good enough or I never made enough money. My x could be very charming and we\r\nalways threw the best parties and had the house on the water in florida, the boat, the motorcycles,etc. I was in love with \r\nthe lifestyle and the money. Every winter he would go to florida to our \r\nhouse for 4 months and I would fly back and forth. \r\nOne winter 3 yrs ago, I was uncomfortable leaving our then 17 yr old daughter alone. I didnt trust her. So I didnt go to florida that\r\nwinter. He was 50 yrs old, I was 49. He was angry at first that I didnt go but then the phone calls got further apart, he was partying\r\nat this bar down the street from the house. He didnt call the kids one time the whole winter. I never ever thought he was the \r\ncheating type. Not that I am naive but I just figured he wouldnt do it. We had spoken about it numerous times over the \r\nyears and I thought he felt it was as bad a thing to do as i did. Well I was wrong .

Im sure he was flashin\r\nhis money and turning on the fun and charm. Anyhow they started sleeping together. When he came home in march, I knew the \r\nminute he walked in the door. It was weird, I just felt it. ANyway I was watching him and the next morining I caught him texting \r\non the toilet, He never texted so I knew that was weird, so I checked his phone records. Sure enough there it was, hours of talking\r\nto the same number, hundreds of texts. I knew and shortly after, he knew I knew and heres the kicker, he didnt care! Not one bit'\r\nHe was proud of the new gal, defended her to me, started flying to florida to see her etc. He also started drinking more, doing \r\nvicoden, not coming home at night. When he couldnt get me to leave, he went after our youngest daughter. Screaming at her for\r\nhours, chasing her around drunk, laughing at her when she would cry. He would do it if I wasnt there. The last time he did it I packed \r\nour bags and we were gone. For good. WHen I told him I was filing, he beat me to it by a day. He never cared one bit, bad mouthed\r\nme all over town. The girl ended up pregnant with baby #5 within 2 months and now she and her 5 kids live in my dream house, and she \r\nis marrying my x next month. I lost all my friends, I guess they didnt know what to say to me. This all happened in a matter of 4 month period\r\nHe injected himself into our friends again but ultimately chased them away with all his pics of the gf and I just climbed in a hole. I lost my\r\njob d/t layoffs that same year and moved 2 times. Then to cap it off had to put my dad in a nursing home. It has been 2 1/2 years, hes getting\r\nmarried next month. I lost pretty much everything in the divorce because he has so much money I couldnt afford to lose anymore fighting\r\nhim, trust me, he didnt care how long he fought, as long as he won. He continues to treat those kids much better than he ever treated ours \r\nand our daughters are beautiful caring young ladies; 2 of them dont even speak to him.\r\nIt is still incomprehensible what he did to our family, his lack of remorse and all of it was something I am still trying to wrap my mind around\r\nHow you can live withsome one all those years and then just one day, stop caring at all. I swear I thought he had a brain tumor!\r\nI fight myself daily to not seek revenge and I dont always trust myself not to do something, but so far I just keep trying to live my life the \\\r\nbest I can, enjoy my kids and attempt to heal the wounds that his obvious midlife crisis has caused to so many people. I always hope that\r\none day he wakes up at 55 yrs old in a house full of teenagers and younger kids and says what the hell did I do?

It felt like I had bricks tied to my feet.  just over night I went from being active to not being able to get up from a squat, or climb stairs.  \r\nThen after a while it turned into muscle spasms, sometimes severe spasms, almost like an alien might climb out of my legs.\r\nAlso spasms in my eye lids.\r\nNow for the last couple years I've been dealing with extreme, and stabbing nerve pain in my feet.  I'm talking about ever 30 seconds, and with no ryme or reason to it.  Finally about a year ago (maybe less) my Dr. gave me a medication (gabapentin).  It's to numb the nerves.  At first I loved it, It really helped.  I think it took about 80% of the pain away, but now I've worked up to the highest dose of this med, and the pain has come back, and is spreading.  I'm starting to see signs of it effecting my hands (the pain, not the meds).  \r\nI don't know how to best discribe my symptoms, but I'll try:\r\nStabbing pain, like Nails being hammered into my feet.\r\n\"popping popcorn\" in feet and legs.\r\nCreepy crawlies\r\nIf I scan my body, the only thing I can find that doesn't hurt are my lips.

I don't have insurance, so they did just a couple tests and then stopped.  I'm also looking for work, and have no income.  So going to the Dr. is completely out of the question right now.  \r\nI don't know what to do.  I can't take this pain!  I'm a tough cookie, but enough is enough!  I just can't stand the pain!  It's constant!  and getting worse every day!\r\nDoes anyone know what's wrong with me?  I've tried all the stuff like calcium, and vitamin D, and many other things.  Nothing helps!\r\nI have diabetes, but they ruled out neuropothy.  I have bad back problems (scoliosis, and bone on bone in about 4 spots).  They thought that might be a cause, but if my back explains my feet and legs, why am I starting to feel it in my hands, and what's up with the constant spasms in my eye lids?\r\nPlease, can someone help me?

I discovered her addiction the year after we were married. We dated for three years, and having sex was just part of a date. She never refused sex, but could not \"get involved\" with anything outside of intercourse. We argued many times about her refusal to discuss anything sexual. I always wound up addressing the issue as \"I can have the body, but not the mind. We married, and the problem escalated. I traveled for a living, which left her alone many nights. I used to watch her from the bathroom when she masturbated. She always denied doing anything at all. She was very careful not to be caught \"in the act\", and once I did catch her, her defense mechanism kicked in, lying about anything, and trying to change the subject. That never changes in 50 years of marriage. Only once did I wake up with her holding on to me. Needless to say, that night we had intercourse for so long that she begged me to stop because she was about to faint. I guessed that it was because of the multiple orgasms she was having, but she never would admit to anything. Always the lies. Many times, we would have sex at night after going to bed, and I would pretend to be asleep, and sure enough, give it 20 or 30 minutes and I could feel the vibrations of the bed when she \"got off\". Once I woke up and heard her heavy breathing, and her pelvic movements. I turned over, and she literally \"flipped\" over onto her stomach. One finger in her for less than a minute produced a healthy moan from her lips. That was normally impossible  to achieve. She never said anything when we were making love, but on that one night, she could not stop. And, that was with kids in the house. That must have been one hell of an orgasm. But, again, the lies, the denials, and always trying to shift the blame on my traveling, and what she suspected, me, and other women. Even up to the very end, she still masturbated. \r\nI found out quite by accident that she was using a dildo.Not the kind you buy, however. Our first child got a toy baseball bat for his first birthday. It had a squeek built in that would cry out when you hit the bat on something hard. When I found the bat, it was over 30 years since that child had used the bat. When I found it, and confronted her with it, she said that she had started using it when she saw it in his toy box, and that she had used it for 2 or 3 years, and then decided not to use it anymore. That was the biggest lie she had ever told. I know, because many times, when I would return from a trip, and attempt to make love to her, she would not let me enter her fully because she said that it hurt in the back,( the cervix area). When I questioned her, she said she didn't know why it hurt, but that it would go away. What was going on was that she was using the bat as a dildo, and had gotten carried away with it, and banged it against her cervix enough to leave it sore. As I said, when I discovered that she was using the bat, it was fully 30 years since our first child had quit using it, and she was still going at it until I found it. \r\nShe died a couple of weeks ago, and now, I have the task of cleaning out her things. I am a bit apprehensive about just what I'll find when I do that cleaning. I feel pretty sure that something regarding her sexuality will surface. \r\nThe main problem with the addiction was that it prevented any intimacy. She could not say, or do anything that might lead to something else being found out. She never said anything when we made love. She never except that one time ever expressed a need for sex, and she would always \"do her thing\" after we had had sex, and she thought I was asleep. \r\nAnd, that is my story. I would be very interested in hearing others offer up their version of living with an addict. The books I have read all say the same thing. The addict is powerless to stop the addiction.

When they came back two or three weeks later, they often said that they feel much better now but a week ago they had a cold. When I asked about the symptoms they turn out to be mainly a profuse mucus discharge, sometimes also diarrhoea, but rarely are there signs of a real infection. In fact, these patients just experienced their first healing crisis on their long path to better health.\r\n\r\nThis concept of a healing crisis clearly shows the opposite perceptions that drug medicine and holistic medicine have of health and the healing process. In drug medicine it is assumed that a patient who is free of disease symptoms is more or less healthy and the aim of drugs is to achieve this condition by removing any disagreeable symptoms. Frequently alternative or complementary medicine is used in the same way, instead of more or less toxic drugs just more benign remedies are being used. This is what most patients want and according to their beliefs they either use drugs or natural remedies for this purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever, holistic or natural medicine, following in the footsteps of the old nature cure movement, aims much higher. Here, health is regarded not just as a temporary absence of disease symptoms, but as a state of profound physical, emotional and mental wellbeing so that we simply cannot develop or catch a disease.\r\n\r\nAnimals living in an unspoiled natural habitat in the wild commonly display this kind of health. If we want to come close to such outstanding health, we have to work for it by consciously minimising the multitude of negative influences on our health and maximise positive factors instead.\r\n\r\nHowever, experience shows that we do not follow a straight line of either health improvement or health deterioration. Similar to periods of illness interspersing times of relative wellbeing on the common road to chronic degenerative diseases and death, so we have also ups and downs on the road to superior health. The main difference is that the road to deteriorating health on average is sloping downhill while the other road on average goes up in health. Travelling downhill is easy, we do not need to do anything about it, but improving our health requires consistent effort.\r\n\r\nContrary to the often-lengthy periods of ill health on the downhill road, the dips on the uphill road are usually short and sharp. They are called 'healing crisis' although I prefer the less dramatic name 'healing reaction', also 'cleansing reaction' or simply 'reaction'. After each reaction we advance to a higher level of health than before the reaction.\r\n\r\nHolistic therapists realise that the road to better health follows a definite pattern. The old school of nature cure called it\r\n\r\nHERING'S LAW OF CURE:\r\n\r\n\"All cure starts from within out, from the head down and in reverse order as the symptoms have appeared.\"\r\n\r\nDr John Whitman Ray has developed a method specifically designed to help us travel the long road to superior health. He called it Body Electronics, using nutrition as well as press point therapy to facilitate emotional release and expansion of consciousness. Out of this work Dr Ray found it necessary to modify Hering's Law to the following\r\n\r\nLAW OF HEALING CRISIS:\r\n\r\n\"A healing crisis will occur only when an individual is ready both physiologically and psychologically. The basic foundation for all healing is nutritional preparedness. A healing crisis will begin from within out, in reverse order chronologically as to how the symptoms have appeared, tempered by the intensity of the trauma. The individual will have the opportunity to re-experience each trauma, both physiological and psychological, beginning with the trauma of least severity. It must be recognised that traumas involving emotions, which include all traumas, will be released in order, beginning with unconsciousness, then apathy, grief, fear, anger, pain and eventually enthusiasm (love), in conjunction with the appropriate word patterns for each emotion and thought pattern (sensory memory) which are accessible at each level. Unconditional love and unconditional forgiveness are the keys to apply and transmute any resistance at any level, once these resistances are brought to view through the application of the laws of love, light and perfection.\r\n\r\nWith this definition Dr. Ray emphasises the importance of the emotional side of our health problems. Each disease, accident or surgical intervention contains a strong emotional component which needs to be re-experienced during a reaction, otherwise the healing will remain incomplete and the problem will present itself again at a later time for healing at a deeper level.\r\n\r\nThis also means that the body selects the kind of healing crisis that is most appropriate at the time, taking into consideration its needs and abilities to have a certain area healed or improved. We can consciously influence this choice by working on a particular problem. I also noticed that the body self tries to select a timing, which does not disable us during important events coming up. I have no doubt that we are guided on our healing path by our inner intelligence, which has our best interest at heart.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning our healing reactions will be mainly on the physical or biological level, but more and more we will experience the release of emotional blocks and changes in consciousness, preparing us for greater activity on the spiritual level.\r\n\r\nPATTERNS OF HEALING\r\n\r\nIn every real healing, the sequence of our health deterioration will automatically be retraced. This means that old, long-forgotten disease symptoms may suddenly flare up again in the form of a healing crisis. The reason for this is based on the very nature of disease.\r\n\r\nAt first, when the body is still vital, it will react forcefully against invaders; the resulting battle causes fever and inflammation. If the body is not strong enough to win completely, the acute battle symptoms will eventually subside, with the remaining invaders leading a somewhat subdued existence in a weakened gland or organ. Repeated attacks will result in the degeneration of this body part, causing chronic disease.\r\n\r\nAt some stage on the road towards health, the body will feel strong enough to start the fight again for healing the diseased organ, and inflammation will result. Such healing reactions are usually short lived, but can be rather violent. If one supports the body during this period with rest, cleansing diets and so forth, then the organ will eventually acquire a much better health than before the flare-up. If, however, drugs are used to suppress the healing symptoms, then the inflamed organ will return to its subacute, chronic condition and wait for another opportunity to heal itself\r\n\r\nThe healing pattern of other health problems that are not related to immunological processes and infections follows a similar line to that outlined above. Healing takes place on many different levels: at the biochemical level within the cells, in the blood circulation, the nervous system and especially in the flow of bio-energies. Healing activity will be increased on all of these levels\r\n\r\nAt the bio-energetic level, the increased energy flow may cause congestion at various places, in the weak body part itself as well as in related acupuncture points and zone reflex areas. Excess energy in such places may be noticed as pain, heat or tension: the common symptoms of inflammation. In time, the body itself will clear the obstruction in the energy flow.\r\n\r\nOne may support this process with specific healing methods or just by healthy living in general. However, trying to suppress any inflammation may leave the body part permanently weak Inflammation in itself is a healing energy release and it may be best overcome by removing the blockage in the energy flow.\r\n\r\nSKIN REACTIONS\r\n\r\nAnother common form of healing reaction is the development of a rash or other skin problem, especially over a weak body part, for instance at a hip or shoulder. This skin reaction signifies that the energy that had been bound internally in this area in the form of muscle armouring, stiffness and accumulated metabolic wastes, is now surfacing and dissipating. Thus the affected joint or limb will become much freer and stronger. However, if the skin reaction is interfered with and made to go prematurely, then the suppressed energy and metabolic waste will remain in that body part, keeping it in a state of pain or weakness.\r\n\r\nThus there usually is no need to interfere directly with skin diseases or other healing symptoms. On the contrary, that may only drive the problem 'underground' to affect internal organs and body structures. Natural healers have noticed that by artificially producing a rash over an arthritic joint, the joint greatly improved, but when a rash over a joint was artificially suppressed, then arthritic symptoms may appear in that joint.\r\n\r\nYou may actually learn much about yourself, your body, your health problems and your emotional reactions by patiently observing the healing process instead of rushing in to do something about it. What you should do, however, is live healthily in general, cleansing the body, helping the suppressed energy to come out and dissipate and to be optimistic about it all.\r\n\r\nFrequently, boils and increased mucus discharge (colds) may appear during the initial stages of the healing process, sometimes starting already one or two weeks after improving the diet and beginning to take supplements. This indicates that the organs of elimination are congested. During Such times take little food, but generous amounts of herb teas, fresh vegetable juices and water. Preferably go on a cleansing diet.\r\n\r\nYou may notice an advance warning of an approaching healing crisis in the iris, when a formerly grey or brown reflex area becomes whitish. At the same time, the reflex points underneath the feet and on the hands, as well as pressure points related to the activated organ, become more tender and should be pressed. Such healing crises may appear from time to time separated by weeks, months or even years bringing us ever closer to our distant goal of superior health.\r\n\r\nLISTEN TO YOUR BODY\r\n\r\nSome further problems may develop during health improvement. Formerly, the body responses may have been dulled - it did not react to harmful foods or drugs - but now the reaction is often immediate and forceful.\r\n\r\nFoods that you may have eaten habitually before going on a cleansing diet may suddenly cause a gastro-intestinal upset, making you feel sick and miserable for days. However, such reactions do not need to happen if you take proper precautions: find out to which foods you are allergic and try to avoid these as well as foods that may be a problem for you. If you eat out and do not know what to expect, take plenty of digestive enzymes and lecithin during the meal, and try to eat foods in correct combination; if allergy symptoms appear, use alkalisers together with calcium ascorbate.\r\n\r\nBasically, one may say that your body now trusts that you will not hurt it any more in the old ways. But if you do, your body is very offended and lets you (your mind) know about it in no uncertain terms. This is the most effective language that your body has. However, if you learn to listen, your body will first try to tell you about its requirements in a more subtle way - an intestinal rumbling, an itch, a slight muscle weakness or a passing pain. There are numerous ways a body expresses its needs and each one has its own language of symptoms.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you are honest and persistent in your desire to become a friend of your body, it will eventually let you know its needs by intuition, by its likes and dislikes, you will rediscover your lost body instincts. This is what we really should aim for: to become independent of outside expert advice and just do what our body tells us is right for us to do, not only in the field of nutrition, but in everyday living and with important decisions as well.\r\n\r\nWhile one can usually gain relatively quick relief from distressing disease symptoms, rebuilding a strong and healthy body is a slow process and takes a long time. It requires a great deal of experimenting in order to find our individual conditions for healing, and it also needs solid determination to carry through with a program for many years.\r\n\r\nGenerally, recently acquired chronic weaknesses are the first to flare up and become healed, while our oldest and most persistent health problems are the last to yield. Thus there appears to be an orderly sequence in our health improvement. Healing proceeds in a wave pattern with an upward slope. On the peak of a wave we feel much improved, while in a trough we experience cleansing activity or a healing reaction and feel down. The overall movement, however, is towards greater wellbeing.\r\n\r\nJust looking at the symptoms of a reaction, you will not be able to distinguish a healing crisis from a disease crisis -a flare-up on the downhill road to degenerative disease. In fact, the symptoms are the same because the underlying process is the same.\r\n\r\nThe body always tries to heal itself and an acute inflammation is an important tool for this purpose. An inflammation makes the walls of the blood vessels porous to allow an increased flow of lymph fluid to move in immune cells and remove accumulated toxins. At this stage it is just an acute inflammation and we can choose to turn it into a healing crisis by supporting the body mentally and nutritionally or we can choose to suppress the acute condition and return to a chronic degenerative condition.\r\n\r\nTherefore, anything that suppresses an acute inflammation prevents healing of the affected area. This includes not only anti-inflammatory drugs and remedies, but also strong alkalisers that reduce the release of histamine. The pain and heat in the inflamed area is the price we have to pay for it being healed.\r\n\r\nHowever, anti-inflammatory agents and alkalisers have their place to ease the discomfort of a chronic inflammation until the body has been nutritionally and mentally prepared for a healing reaction. Furthermore, the symptoms during a reaction may either be too severe or come at an inopportune time. Then you can lessen or temporarily stop them by adding cooked food to a raw food cleansing diet or by alkalising the body and using anti-inflammatory remedies.\r\n\r\nUsually we can select a suitable time for a healing crisis by starting a strict cleanse on raw food only, especially fresh vegetable juices or fruit, possibly also vegetable salads. A fruit cleanse is more suitable for insensitive individuals and vegetables are much better with an over-acid and sensitive body.\r\n\r\nOne of the main factors reducing the severity of any symptoms is a clean bowel, regardless whether the reaction was triggered deliberately or involuntarily. The easiest way to do this is by taking a tablespoon of Epsom salts (more or less according to bowel reaction) in water at bedtime or on rising. If no solid food is used then take a teaspoon of psyllium hulls several times daily in a glass of unchloriated water. Too little water can cause constipation.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ease or shorten a reaction is press-point therapy: strongly press into tender points on the feet and body related to problem areas until the points lose their tenderness. This may take hours or days with some key points. You can further support your body with light, enjoyable outdoors activity. Also prayer and meditation or guided imagery are recommended.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is no simple path to completely avoid health-related suffering. We can only choose in which way we want to suffer. We can either deliberately and cheerfully endure the unpleasantness of repeated healing crises with the promise of better health to follow, or we can expect to suffer involuntarily and in an uncontrolled way from chronic-degenerative diseases as we get older. The choice is ours.\r\n\r\n ", "/groups/thigh_pain": "There are a lot of posts in a lot of forums about people, like me, who suffer from differing degrees of Thigh pain.

This is a support group for people who are having anxiety issues feeling that they may have been infected with HIV. Some of you are in the window period and waiting for an accurate result. Some of you may have tested negativr, but still think you are showing symptoms and can't believe your test results. This is a support group so we can all come together and support each other. In this time I know how lonely it can be, but KNOW you are not alone.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re concerned that you may be entering into an episode of stress depression and anxiety, this support group will be for you. You\u2019ll want to know the psychological symptoms and the physical symptoms associated with these problems and how they affect sufferers. Here are the most common physical and psychological symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety: \r\n\r\n         Lack of energy. This common symptom is common to stress depression and anxiety and no matter how much you try, you just can\u2019t seem to get energized for anything. This affects motivation and so you\u2019re in a catch 22 situation. The less energetic you feel, the more your motivation levels drop. The less motivated you feel, the lower your energy levels become.  \r\n \r\n\r\n      Exhaustion. This is major symptom of depression and it is so debilitating. This is a different kind of exhaustion than the exhaustion you feel say after strenuous physical exercise. In depression, the exhaustion is mentally and physically crushing. Even performing simple daily tasks is way too difficult and it doesn\u2019t matter how much you sleep, the exhaustion just won\u2019t go away. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Trembling Hands. This is mainly a stress or anxiety symptom. The sufferer may be in such an anxious, fearful state that the body floods with powerful chemicals such as adrenaline. In this state, the brain is in a high status of alert and trembling hands are one of the most noticeable, uncontrollable physical symptoms of stress and anxiety. Until of course, the root cause of these problems is addressed and the trembles will then disappear. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Disturbed Sleeping Patterns: This symptom is common to stress, depression and anxiety and it works in 2 main ways. The suffer will either sleep too much or more likely, will only sleep for a couple of hours a night, maybe even less. In many cases, sleep is disrupted because of vivid nightmares, which some sufferers may not even remember. Other sufferers have recurring nightmares. Although these vivid dreams may cause distress, please realize that it isn\u2019t representing anything about you, it is the stress, depression or anxiety that is causing the brain to work overtime and these vivid dreams are a symptom of this, so please don\u2019t blame yourself or feel guilty. The nightmares will disappear once stress, depression and anxiety are under control. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Excessive Worry. Among the more common psychological anxiety, depression and stress symptoms, excessive worry means the sufferer worries about even the smallest of life\u2019s events. A sufferer will be unable to find positive outcomes to anything and will continually assign negative outcomes to all situations. In continually assigning negative outcomes, life becomes very hard as sufferers are in a fearful state of mind for prolonged periods, a state that harms the body as well as the mind. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Irritable. Irritability is a major stress symptom as anyone who\u2019s been under severe stress (and most of us have at some point in our lives) will know this all too well. When you\u2019re under stress, you are stretched to your limit and your patience levels are thin. This explains why even the slightest thing can cause a sufferer to lose their temper or be off-handed or curt towards others. And even when the slightest mishap or accident occurs as they do so often during our daily routines, it will fuel the frustration causing more aggressive or nasty behaviour. Again, this is a symptom of stress and the irritability goes away when stress is relieved. \r\n \r\n\r\n     Isolation. Wanting to shut out the world is another major symptom of depression, although stress sufferers can sometimes seek solitude too. Retreating into a solitary, lonely world further pushes the sufferer down the depression spiral \u2013 it\u2019s like self imposed solitary confinement \u2013 making it even harder for sufferers to find a way out of depression. This is because sufferers feel uncomfortable or even awkward around others and would rather be alone to avoid this feeling. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Panic. This anxiety symptom arises because the sufferer is convinced a catastrophic outcome to an event - or a number of events - in life is imminent. Possible examples could include a wedding, a house move, a work situation, relationship issues, illness, flying, or speaking in public. Sufferers simply cannot change this focus and the more they think about this catastrophe, the more panic stricken they become. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to address this so a person doesn\u2019t enter the spiral that leads to panic. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Worthless Feelings. A symptom of depression although stress sufferers may also feel this way sometimes. This is a terrible feeling to have. Sufferers lose all sense of self worth, self esteem plummets and overly critical self-deprecation is performed, adding to the torment. Self confidence erodes away to nothing and at this point, an individual will find no joy in life, including pastimes and activities that previously brought them so much joy and happiness. The good news is that confidence and self esteem are skills that can be re-learned and along with many other skills form a crucial part in treating depression. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Guilt. Another of the psychological symptoms common to stress, anxiety and depression, guilt can be a heavy burden for sufferers because it\u2019s a lose-lose situation: They will feel guilty about things they\u2019ve done or they will feel guilty about things they didn\u2019t do. A continual replaying of events accompanied by regrets and \u201cIf only..\u201d causes deep emotional anguish and heaps yet more torment on to an already tormented person. Guilt really is a powerful, destructive but ultimately worthless emotion yet the harm it inflicts on sufferers is immense. Guilt, like many other emotions, can be dealt with very effectively and this is another important skill to master in managing stress, depression and anxiety. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Headaches: Another common symptom of stress, depression and anxiety. This is a physical symptom and in some cases, the headaches turn into migraine, especially for people under severe stress. This is one symptom that shows problems like stress, depression and anxiety aren\u2019t \u201call in your mind\u201d and clearly demonstrates how stress, depression and anxiety have physical as well as mental symptoms.\r\n \r\n\r\n      Muscle Pain: Mainly a symptom of depression but stress sufferers may also suffer muscle pain. Muscle pain symptoms will typically be backache and leg cramps. These symptoms can be so painful, and a problem is that sufferers will be unaware that the pain is a symptom of depression. Once the depression is controlled, the pain vanishes.\r\n \r\n\r\n      Racing Heartbeat: Not so common with depression, more a symptom of anxiety and stress. Again, the highly-aroused emotional state floods the body with adrenaline and the heart rate rises. This may also cause \u201cbutterflies\u201d in the tummy as well. \r\n \r\n\r\n      Loss of Appetite. A symptom common to stress, anxiety and depression, loss of appetite is perhaps one of the most obvious consequences of stress, anxiety and depression because of the emotional state of the sufferer. No one feels like eating when they\u2019re frightened, panic stricken or feeling worthless and exhausted. There are some sufferers whose appetites have increased dramatically but they are in the minority. Loss of appetite is more common, and reducing food intake further affects energy levels and deprives the body of nourishment, further exacerbating stress, depression and anxiety. It\u2019s important to note that the causes of stress, depression and anxiety are not rooted in diet and diet alone cannot cure any of them. However, healthy eating does have a part to play, and it should be a part of your stress, anxiety and depression treatment.\r\n \r\n\r\n      Loss of Sex Drive. Just as above, this symptom occurs because of the emotional state of the sufferer. Paradoxically, many people who are depressed can seek emotional re-assurance from sex even though their sexual appetite has decreased. So loss of sex drive doesn\u2019t necessarily mean abstinence from sex. This is more common to depressed women than men, as for men, being in a highly stressed, anxious or depressed state can make the physical act of sex nigh-on impossible. For reasons that I hope are so obvious I need not go into any more detail! Again, as with the other symptoms, your sex drive will  return once stress, depression and anxiety have been brought under control.    \r\n\r\n", "/groups/you_are_not_alone_": "A place you can be honest about the drugs you take and not be judged.", "/groups/you_name_it": "Any thing that makes you think wisely", "/groups/___teen_mother_s_group___": "I am starting this group because i my self is a teen mother...

I started on Paxil on and off for a little while, and then I was put on Zoloft around the age of 18. I was on Zoloft for about two years or so. Then I tried Lexapro for a year.

However, instead of pain, symptoms may include numbness. Either is refered to as neuropathy.
